# Data-Wrangle-Project
A project about Data Wrangling (gathering, Access and Cleaning the data).

In this project we apply the concepts of Data Wrangling.

There are Three files 
* `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv.`
* `tweet-json.txt.`
* `image-predictions.tsv.`

the first two files are extracted from a twitter account [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) ( it's a twitter account that rates dogs around the world).

And the third is a data for the result of an AI algorithms that detects whether the dog has a breed or not.

In this project we apply the concepts of (gathering, access, and cleaning) the data.

All the wrangling is done in `wrangle_act.ipynb` notebook with some simple analysis and visualisation.

If you aren't experienced with Jupyter Notebooks or don't know how to render the file you can use the `html` version of it in `wrangle_act.html`

not all the data is cleaned of course but some are I would like just to show examples of wrangling steps.
